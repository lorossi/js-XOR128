# js XOR128

XOR128 pseudo-random number generator.
Based on the implementation by [WizCorp](https://github.com/Wizcorp/xor128/).

Check the docs here: [lorossi.github.io/js-XOR128/](https://lorossi.github.io/js-XOR128/).

Download [here](https://github.com/lorossi/js-XOR128/releases/latest) the last version.

## Tests

To run the tests:

- clone the repository
- host the `test` folder with a web server
- open the `index.html` file in a browser
- tests will be run automatically via [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)

There are two categories of tests:

- **unit tests**, to test the single methods and the instantiation of the class
- **randomness tests**, to test the randomness of the generated numbers

The randomness test performed are:

- Chi-square test
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Bernoulli test

All with a confidence threshold of 0.05.
This does not ensure that the generator is truly random, but it is a good indicator.
